'''
Implement a function calleld sort_students that takes a list of student objects as inputs and sorts the
list based on their CGPA (Cumulativess Grade Point Average) in descending order. Each student object
has the following attributes: name (string), roll_number (string),and cgpa (float). Test the function
with different input of students.
'''
class Student:

 
  def __init__(self, name, roll_number, cgpa):
    self.name = name 
    self.roll_number = roll_number
    self.cgpa = cgpa


def sort_students(student_list):
  # Sort the list of students in discending order of CGPA
  sorted_students = sorted(student_list,
                           key=lambda student: student.cgpa,
                           reverse=True)
  #Syntax lambda arg:exp
  return sorted_students


#Example usage:
students = [
    Student("Priya", "A123", 7.8),
    Student("Dinesh", "A124", 8.9),
    Student("Janani", "A125", 9.1),
    Student("Roshan", "A126", 9.9),
]


sorted_students = sort_students(students)

#Print the sorted list of students
for student in sorted_students:
  print("Name: {}, Roll Number: {}, CGPA: {}".format(student.name,
                                                                 student.roll_number,

                                                 student.cgpa))
